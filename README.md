Code for Kaggle's StumbleUpon Evergreen Classification Challenge

To run, run the code BS Man+, Foxtrot+, Logit, and Zygmuntz+, then run the code in Stacking.  (See the README's in each directory.) 

	BS MAN+ contains code for classifying using naive bayes
	
	FOXTROT+ contains code for classifying using vowpal wabbit
	
	LOGIT contains code for classifying using logistic regression
	
	ZYGMUNTZ+ contains code for classifying using a neural network optimized for sparse matrices
	
	STACKING contains code for performing model stacking on the previous four models, using either SVC or logistic regression.
