Code for Kaggle's StumbleUpon Evergreen Classification Challenge

To run, run the code in Naive_Bayes, Vowpal_Wabbit, Logit, and SparseNN, then run the code in Stacking.  (See the README's in each directory.) 

	NAIVE_BAYES contains code for classifying using naive bayes, and is based on code by Kaggle user BS Man
	
	VOWPAL_WABBIT contains code for classifying using vowpal wabbit, and is based on code by Kaggle user Foxtrot
	
	LOGIT contains code for classifying using logistic regression, and is based on the NAIVE_BAYES code
	
	SPARSENN contains code for classifying using a neural network optimized for sparse matrices, and is based on code by Kaggle user Zygmuntz
	
	STACKING contains code for performing model stacking on the previous four models, using either SVC or logistic regression.
